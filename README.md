# express-rest-test
A simple Express RestAPI with test using mocha and supertest!! :D (I know too many tests!)

install the dependencies using:
    ### npm install

start the server to check it:
    ### npm start

test the endpoints:
    ### npm test


Very simple basic RestAPI using express

Yes, it has tests using mocha and supertest
